              <p>Ireatnifis is one of the two first gods in the EndfallenSMP universe. He was betrayed by his brother, Nihiletomnis‚Äîthe First God‚Äîwho attempted to merge with him again after their ancient separation, seeking to reclaim his lost power. Ireatnifis prevailed, but at the cost of his brother‚Äôs life.

                Since then, he has despised everything connected to the First God, seeking to erase all remnants and rebuild the world from nothing.
                
                What happens to the souls of those he "erases"? Some say those turned to stone become his eternal puppets.</p>

                    Sin is a 50-year-old Avian born of low heritage, long cast out by her own people. Orphaned by war, neglected as a child, and later exiled for becoming a mother too young, she lost her only son after being rejected by every race she turned to for help. When her son died in her arms, her rage awakened. She struck back at her people before vanishing across the sea.
                    
                    But her story didn‚Äôt end there.
                    
                    An ignorant king once broke into her home, leaving behind a letter that would change her fate. She met Lily‚Äîa mysterious figure who promised to bring her son back. The boy returned, but something felt wrong. He grew up unnaturally fast. Eventually, Sin learned the truth: her son had become a vessel for the Founder.
                    
                    The Founder, who had once killed her, now used her son to do it again. After that second death, Sin was dragged to the Nether and tortured for eight relentless years.
                    
                    She survived.
                    
                    But what remained was not the same woman the world once exiled.

                    Raised by an elven man, she learned the ways of solitude, independence, and silence. Her vision had always been poor‚Äîshe wore glasses more out of habit than help, yet she never complained. One evening, as they sat together at the edge of a cliff, the elf spoke of a woman from long ago. A curious human who once asked simple questions that stirred ancient thoughts. That night, something changed. Her memory fractured. When she awoke, her hands were stained with blood‚Äîfresh, warm, and hers... yet not. Her sight faded, her eyes became unbearable to look at, and so she hid them behind a blindfold. 
                    
                    The curse revealed itself slowly: blood eternally clung to her hands, unable to be washed, wiped, or transferred. No food spoiled, no cloth stained‚Äîonly her hands remained marked. Whether it was punishment, vengeance, or sorrow given form, she does not know. All she remembers is the echo of a dying question: "Do elves ever wonder how time leaves them behind?" And now she walks alone, haunted not by what she‚Äôs lost‚Äîbut by what she may have done.

                    He awoke on a forgotten shore, soaked in salt and silence, with only the crashing of waves and a vague sense of d√©j√† vu for company. Something about him felt... broken, as though fragments of a former life drifted just out of reach. The ocean whispered to him‚Äîof oaths made, a heartbeat shared, of wings now lost and memories buried beneath time. He moved with unnatural lightness, instinct guiding feet that had walked paths he couldn‚Äôt recall.
                    
                    Voices haunted him‚Äîone in particular, a woman‚Äôs, echoing deep within his mind. And yet, he pressed forward. Danvar, the man who once bore wings, now wore a coat lined with gold and determination. He believed in sharing power, not wealth. He believed in unity, not indulgence. When he seized the crown of the Poburg Empire, he wasted no time. "This empire is scattered," he proclaimed. "To survive, we must be reborn at sea." And so he laid the foundation for a new colony‚Äîa floating haven for all who needed shelter.
                    
                    But the burden grew. El Diabolo twisted in his thoughts, and Danvar saw truths he wasn‚Äôt ready to accept. The old man‚Ä¶ was him. Or could be. And Lily‚ÄîLily stirred feelings he did not understand. He pushed her away, told her to leave, yet felt pain from her absence. He clung to small joys‚Äîlike cooking‚Äîjust to feel something normal again. In the eyes of his people, he was a king reborn. In his own, he was a soul adrift, searching for what had been forgotten.
