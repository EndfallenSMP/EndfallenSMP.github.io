    <h1>The Origin of the World</h1>
  <p>The world started when Will forged through Order. This began an event, forging a world through grit and fire. As they cycled, following and chasing one another, they wept against the stone and lava that kept them apart. Their tears created rivers and oceans as Wrath was born from the depths of the sea, feeling the warmth of the underworld and the stillness of the earth. In this moment, a layer—thin and impenetrable—separated Will from Order.</p>
  <h2>The War of the Gods</h2>
  <p>Elders say the war began as a disagreement between Will and Wrath. Wrath was dissatisfied with Will, claiming he was too kind to the mortals they ruled over. In a moment of pure rage at being ignored and dismissed, Wrath raised the oceans and killed hundreds of thousands of mortal people. This began a godly war that spanned 200 years. Will forced the earth to bubble forth, reclaiming what was once land from the sea. As the gods of Life and Rebirth raised their radiance and caused a drought, even more death followed as they all began to fight for dominance. Floods, earthquakes, droughts, and darkness raged in cycles for 200 years.</p>
  <p>Order, unable to leave their realm, decided to sacrifice their power to weaken the others. Over 10 years, they slowly gave away their power, weakening the others until they were all too drained to continue and retreated to their domains to rest. For 100 years, it is predicted they would slumber. The elders spoke of a time when the gods would return, either to help or hinder mortals.</p>
  <h2>The Age of Mortals</h2>
  <p>During those 100 years, the world struggled to return to balance without divine influence. Now, those who remain of humanity gather to form the foundation of three new kingdoms. New civilizations and cultures rise, blending traditions old and new as the gods begin to stir once more. Whether their intentions are chaotic, selfish, or pure, remains unknown.</p>
  <p>All that is left now is to explore and see what becomes of the last of humanity.</p>
  <h2>The Birth of Day and Night</h2>
  <p>Order, in its longing for the earth, made the sun. Will, in its need to remember the dark, forged the moon in a halo of light. There, Life and Rebirth were born—giving rise to day and night as we know them.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Wrath brewed beneath the sea, still unsatisfied.</p>
  <h2>The Forgotten Gods</h2>
  <p>Within this world reside four gods. While I cannot say their names or abilities for certain, I know they were once widely worshiped. But in times of war and struggle, they were forgotten. Their temples now lay abandoned in distant corners of the world, their offerings discarded, their teachings lost.</p>
  <p>Some still believe, though their beliefs are but shadows of what once was. Kingdoms have risen and fallen under their blessings and curses. Will your kingdom survive or struggle? Only time and luck will tell.</p>
  <p>
    You can contribute to this growing story. As the world recovers from the last war, the gods awaken from their slumber and return from their meditation to witness what has become of the people they once watched with keen interest.
